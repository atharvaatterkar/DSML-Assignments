K-Means Clustering Program
Overview
This Python program performs k-means clustering on a collection of 8 points. It then answers specific questions regarding the clustering results.

Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/k-means-clustering.git 

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd k-means-clustering


Run the program using Python:
python k_means_clustering.py
Input Data
The input data consists of 8 points:

P1=[0.1,0.6]
P2=[0.15,0.71]
P3=[0.08,0.9]
P4=[0.16,0.85]
P5=[0.2,0.3]
P6=[0.25,0.5]
P7=[0.24,0.1]
P8=[0.3,0.2]
Questions Answered
Cluster of Point P6: The program determines which cluster Point P6 belongs to.
Population of Cluster around m2 (P8): It calculates the number of points in the cluster around centroid P8.
Updated Centroid Values: The program updates the centroid values for both clusters.
Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system to run the program. Also, make sure the required libraries such as NumPy are installed.
