Data Analysis and Modeling with R/Python
Overview
This repository contains code samples and instructions for performing various data analysis and modeling tasks using R and Python. The tasks include computing summary statistics for each feature, data visualization using histograms, data cleaning, integration, transformation, and building a classification model.

Contents
data: Folder containing the dataset(s) used for analysis.
scripts: Folder containing R and Python scripts for performing data analysis and modeling tasks.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
Tasks
a) Computing Summary Statistics
Calculate and display summary statistics for each feature in the dataset. This includes minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance, and percentiles.

b) Data Visualization
Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the distributions of the features.

c) Data Cleaning, Integration, Transformation
Perform data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, outliers, or duplicates. Integrate data from multiple sources if applicable. Perform necessary transformations on the data to prepare it for modeling.

d) Data Model Building (Classification)
Build a classification model using suitable algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest) to predict target variables based on the features in the dataset.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-analysis-and-modeling.git


Navigate to the repository directory:
cd data-analysis-and-modeling
Run the scripts in the scripts folder using R/Python interpreters to perform the desired data analysis and modeling tasks.
