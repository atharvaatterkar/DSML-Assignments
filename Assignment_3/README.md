Customer Response Prediction for Special Offers in Cosmetics Shop
Overview
This repository contains code samples and instructions for predicting customer response to special offers in a cosmetics shop using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of details of customers and their responses to previous special offers.

Contents
data: Folder containing the dataset(s) collected from the cosmetics shop.
scripts: Folder containing R and Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
Age: Age of the customer
Gender: Gender of the customer
Annual Income: Annual income of the customer
Spending Score: Spending score assigned to the customer
Response: Response to previous special offers (target variable)
Tasks
1. Data Preprocessing
Perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Visualize distributions, correlations, and other patterns in the data.

3. Feature Selection
Select relevant features that can contribute to predicting customer response to special offers.

4. Model Building
Apply appropriate machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, or gradient boosting to build predictive models for customer response prediction.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of the trained models using suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-response-prediction.git


Navigate to the repository directory:
cd customer-response-prediction
Run the scripts in the scripts folder using R/Python interpreters to perform data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
