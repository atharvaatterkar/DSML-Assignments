Regression Analysis on Temperature Data
Overview
This repository contains code samples and instructions for performing regression analysis on temperature data of India. The analysis includes applying linear regression, assessing the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics, and visualizing a simple regression model.

Contents
data: Folder containing the temperature dataset (temperatures.csv).
scripts: Folder containing Python scripts for regression analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
Data
The temperature data is downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset consists of monthly temperature averages recorded across various places in India, with temperatures recorded in Celsius.

Tasks
a) Linear Regression Analysis
Apply linear regression using a suitable library function to predict the month-wise temperature.
b) Model Performance Assessment
Assess the performance of regression models using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Square metrics.
c) Visualization of Regression Model
Visualize a simple regression model to understand the relationship between variables.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/temperature-regression-analysis.git

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd temperature-regression-analysis
Run the Python scripts in the scripts folder to perform regression analysis on the temperature data.
