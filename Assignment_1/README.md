Overview
This repository contains code samples and instructions for performing various data manipulation tasks using R and Python. The tasks include reading data from different formats, indexing and selecting data, sorting data, describing attributes of data, checking data types, counting unique values, converting variable data types, identifying missing values, and filling them in.

Contents
data: Folder containing sample datasets in different formats like CSV, XLS.
scripts: Folder containing R and Python scripts for performing data manipulation tasks.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
Tasks
a) Reading Data from Different Formats
Use appropriate functions in R/Python to read data from CSV and XLS files.

b) Indexing and Selecting Data, Sorting Data
Demonstrate how to index and select specific data elements from datasets. Also, illustrate sorting of data based on specific columns.

c) Describing Attributes of Data, Checking Data Types
Show how to describe attributes of datasets such as mean, median, min, max, etc. Also, check the data types of each column.

d) Counting Unique Values, Converting Variable Data Type
Provide code to count unique values of data and demonstrate converting variable data types like from long to short, vice versa.

e) Identifying Missing Values and Filling Them In
Illustrate how to identify missing values in datasets and fill them in with appropriate methods.
