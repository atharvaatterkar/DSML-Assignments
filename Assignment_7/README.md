Classification Analysis on Graduate Admissions Data
Overview
This repository contains code samples and instructions for performing classification analysis on graduate admissions data. The analysis includes data pre-processing, data preparation, applying a machine learning algorithm (Decision Tree), and evaluating the model.

Contents
data: Folder containing the graduate admissions dataset (Admission_Predict.csv).
scripts: Folder containing Python scripts for classification analysis.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
Data
The graduate admissions dataset contains features such as GRE Scores, TOEFL Scores, University Rating, Statement of Purpose strength, Letter of Recommendation strength, Undergraduate GPA, Research Experience, and the target variable Admitted (0=no, 1=yes).

Tasks
a) Data Pre-processing
Apply data pre-processing techniques such as label encoding and data transformation if necessary.
b) Data Preparation
Perform data preparation by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
c) Machine Learning Algorithm
Apply a Decision Tree algorithm to build a classification model.
d) Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/graduate-admissions-classification.git

Navigate to the repository directory:
cd graduate-admissions-classification
Run the Python scripts in the scripts folder to perform classification analysis on the admissions data.
